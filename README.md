This is my first Laravel project , I tried to use the basics I know, I didn't really focused on the Logic so "I'll keep updating this repo and adding more features".

How to run my project :

First you must know that there is no option to create an admin user, so you should give this role in cmd .
Follow this:

type this command in cmd : php artisan make-admin user_id

Where user_id is the id of the user which you want to promote to admin.

Finally, you can promote a user to admin by promoting em from the admin dashboard which is only for the admin users.
