# Twitter-clone-laravel
This is my first Laravel project , I tried to use the basics I know, I didn't really focused on the Logic so "I'll keep updating this repo and adding more features".

## How to use

- Copy __.env.example__ file to __.env__ and edit database credentials there
- Run __composer install__
- Run __php artisan key:generate__
- Run __php artisan migrate --seed__ (it has some seeded data for your testing)
- That's it: launch the main URL.
- You can login as an admin using __admin@admin.com__ and __12345678__ as a password.
- Register a new user if you want to try the normal user features also.

## License

Basically, feel free to use and re-use any way you want.
